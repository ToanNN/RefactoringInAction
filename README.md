# Refactoring In Action
This repository contains practice code following Martin Fowler's "Refactoring" book.
The art of refactoring has three steps:
1. Decomposing the original function into a set of smaller functions
2. Separating concerns, such as calculation logic from formatting code.
3. Introducing a polymorphic calculator instead of if/else or switch statements
